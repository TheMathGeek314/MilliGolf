# MilliGolf

A mod for the game Hollow Knight.

## Integrations

### Randomizer 4

The Milligolf content can be used as a Randomizer 4 connection, which allows players to:

- Randomize access to each course, making you require one obtain to enter each course.
- Randomize course completion, which will make you obtain an item the first time you clear each course, and prevent you from viewing your score on the board until the completion check is obtained.
- Randomize global goals. Milligolf does have special achievements for clearing all courses in less than N hits. The obtention of said marks can be randomized, making you obtain an item when reaching the course thresholds and checking the scoreboard instead.
- Randomize course transitions, which will add the tent door as well as all the individual course doors to the transition pool for room or door randomizers.

Note that enabling Door Rando (from TrandoPlus), Course Access and Course Transitions currently causes generation to enter an infinite loop.
